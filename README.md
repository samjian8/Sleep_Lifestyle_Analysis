# Sleep_Lifestyle_Analysis

This project explores the "Insights into Sleep Patterns and Daily Habits" dataset from Kaggle. The primary goal of this beginner-level project is to build familiarity with Python data analysis libraries, including:

Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

Through this project, I analyzed various aspects of sleep quality, stress levels, and daily habits to uncover potential relationships and trends.
